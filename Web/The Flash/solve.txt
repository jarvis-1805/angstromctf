DOM change breakpoints
Use a DOM change breakpoint when you want to pause on the code that changes a DOM node or its children.

To set a DOM change breakpoint:

1.    Click the Elements tab.
2.    Go the element that you want to set the breakpoint on.
3.    Right-click the element.
4.    Hover over Break on then select Subtree modifications, Attribute modifications, or Node removal.

Adding a break point on line "const _0x24a935 = _0x15c166;" in flash.js.
Then F10 we'll get to see the changes in the DOM revealing the flag:
actf{sp33dy_l1ke_th3_fl4sh}
